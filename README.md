## Overview

Contributions is a JavaScript-based program that automates the generation of backdated commits to a GitHub repository. It uses randomly generated dates and timestamps from the past year. This tool updates a `.json` file with the commit date, adds the changes to Git, creates commits with the backdated timestamp, and pushes them to the provided GitHub repository. 

You can download the latest version of Contributions from the [Releases](https://github.com/nassim13ALG/contributions/releases) section.

## Features

- **Automated Backdated Commits**: Generate commits with random dates from the past year.
- **JSON Configuration**: Easily update commit dates in a `.json` file.
- **Git Integration**: Automatically add, commit, and push changes to your GitHub repository.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust settings to fit your specific needs.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any system that supports Node.js.

- **repository**: Your GitHub repository URL.
- **commitCount**: The number of backdated commits to generate.
- **dateRange**: Specify the range of dates for the commits.

  "commitCount": 10,
  "dateRange": {
    "start": "2022-01-01",
    "end": "2022-12-31"
